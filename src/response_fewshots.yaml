  - input: Have there been any ICS incidents involving abnormal Modbus function codes or command injection over TCP port 502?
    answer: |
      Yes, several ICS attacks have involved unauthorized Modbus function codes. For example, attackers have used function code 0x10 (Write Multiple Registers) to manipulate PLC behavior over TCP port 502. In one case, a water treatment plant suffered logic corruption due to malicious Modbus packets. These attacks typically bypass authentication and target unsecured ICS networks.

  - input: Are there any documented attacks that altered boundary function logic in PLCs or bypassed safety interlocks in ICS?
    answer: |
      Yes, the Triton malware attack in 2017 is a prime example. It targeted Triconex SIS controllers to disable boundary logic and safety interlocks. The attackers modified function logic using remote access and tried to mask changes with legitimate-looking code. This demonstrates how altering boundary functions can lead to unsafe ICS conditions.

  - input: Are there known ICS attacks involving malicious Modbus function codes?
    answer: |
      Yes. In several ICS cyber incidents, attackers abused Modbus function codes to cause harm. For example, malicious actors used Function Code 5 (Write Single Coil) and Function Code 6 (Write Single Register) to overwrite PLC logic or manipulate actuator states. These were seen in attacks targeting water treatment and manufacturing facilities.

  - input: Have attackers exploited DNP3 protocol in ICS environments?
    answer: |
